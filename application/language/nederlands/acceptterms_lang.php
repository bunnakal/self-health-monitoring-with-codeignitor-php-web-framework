The primary purpose of use of an electronic ID card issued by the police is to prove the identity of the holder. The electronic ID card can also be used by Finnish citizens as a travel document when
travelling in European Union Member States and in Liechtenstein, San Marino and Switzerland. An electronic ID card on which health insurance information has been included is used as a personal
health insurance card (Kela card). The electronic ID card also contains a technical component enabling e-services to be used. The
citizen certificate in the technical component of the ID card consists of certificate pairs which have two different purposes of use: an authentication and encryption certificate and a signature
certificate, which is a qualified certificate complying with the Act on Strong Electronic Identification and Electronic Signatures. Authenticity of identity is guaranteed by the Population Register Centre.
An electronic ID card is valid for five years from the date of issue. As the Certificate Authority the Population Register Centre individualises the certificate by means of the holder's electronic client
identifier, which is also an element of the certificate’s information content.<br> USING AN ELECTRONIC ID CARD A PIN (Personal Identification Number) must be entered in order to use an ID card. There are two
PIN codes. PIN1 is a basic PIN with which the user controls maintenance and electronic identification of the ID card. PIN2 is a signature PIN code, which allows the user to create an
electronic signature. If the user enters the PIN1 incorrectly three times, the card locks and the function protection by the PIN code can no longer be used. Locking of PIN1 prevents the use of all
applications protected by the PIN code. Locking of PIN2 prevents the use of the electronic signature. Locked PIN codes are released by means of a Pin Unblocking Key (PUK).
A HelpDesk for chip embedded ID card use and electronic services are available every day between 8 am and 10 pm on 0600 9 6160 (local call charge/mobile charge). Service for those with
impaired hearing is available free of charge at http://www.tekstipuhelu.fi. CHANGING THE PIN CODE
An ID card holder may change his PIN code himself on his home computer by using card reader software, which is available free of charge at http://www.fineid.fi.ORDERING A PUK CODE
A PUK code is requested in person at the licence service point of a police department. The identity of the applicant is checked at the same time. The PUK code is sent to the postal address notified
by the applicant within a week of the request. A request to unlock a locked electronic ID card at a police department costs €10. A Population Register Centre fee of €10 for requesting the letter
containing the PUK code is charged. The total price of the service (request to unlock a locked electronic ID card and requesting the letter containing the PUK code) is €20.";
